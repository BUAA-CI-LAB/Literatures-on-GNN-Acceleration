# Courses About Deep Learning On Graph


### [1] [CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/)
> - **Stanford / Winter 2021**
> - [**Course Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA)
> - **Introduction:**  
It is a Stanford University course specialising in machine learning on graphs. It has publicly available slides from their lectures as well as recommended reading. Good if you want to follow a well-structured course on a systematic basis.

### [2] [Algorithms on Graphs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs)
> - **UC San Diego**
> - **Introduction:**  
In this course, you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about shortest paths algorithms â€” from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project. We will finish with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.
