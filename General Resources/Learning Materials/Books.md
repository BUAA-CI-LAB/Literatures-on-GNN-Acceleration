# Books About Deep Learning On Graph


### [1] [Graph Representation Learning](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S01045ED1V01Y202009AIM046)
> - **William L. Hamilton / 2020**
> - **Introduction:**  
This book is a game changer and is currently available as pre-publication that can be downloaded online. It starts with beginners topics such as graph theory and traditional graph approaches to more advanced topics such as novel GNN models and state-of-the-art GNN research. It is a well designed and self-contained material that has most of the required theory for graph neural networks.


### [2] [Network Science](http://networksciencebook.com/)
> - **Albert-László Barabási**
> - **Introduction:**  
It is an interactive book available online that focuses on the graph and networks theory. While it doesn’t discuss GNNs, it is an excellent resource to get strong foundations for operating on graphs.
